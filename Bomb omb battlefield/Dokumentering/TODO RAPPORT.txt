Report
Write a ~ 5 page report (in Swedish or English) with the following layout:

• Cover page, containing information about date, course, group members
and project name.

• Introduction. Describe the scene in terms of type, style, story (?)
and intended application.

• Implementation. Describe the main techniques used during development,
categorized under modelling (sculpting), materials/lighting and
animation. Focus on parts that are not immediately obvious or visible
to a reader. Animations can be presented as a sequences of a images
at a few frames, ideally with joints exposed (if used).

• Results. Final renderings of your scene, from at least a handful of
views (far, close, different angles). Explain to the reader what is shown.

• Future Work (optional) Did something not turn out as expected?
What could have been done better?

• References. No exhaustive reference list is required, but include the
main sources to your work, such as the course book, online resources
for textures, tutorials etc.
